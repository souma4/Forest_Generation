# Forest_Generation

A fun mini project to generate a random forest of trees following a poisson process and simple exclusion criteria.

Diameters follow a Weibull based on [Maltamo & Gobakken, 2013](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-017-8663-8_9#:~:text=Diameter%20distribution%20of%20trees%20is,value%2C%20growth%20and%20biodiversity%20factors.) and heights I left as a user defined function of dbh, largely because research agrees that height varies a ton.

This is licensed under MIT, and if anyone wants to add to it feel free too. Also open to code reviews to improve things such as efficiency, scaleability, etc.
